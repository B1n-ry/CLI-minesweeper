This is a small implementation of minesweeper as a CLI application I wrote in rust
* Why does this exist?
I'm developing as a part of a group a CPU that should be able to run minesweeper in a similar fashion to this, so this is a proof of concept of how things can
work, but also to get an idea what will be required on the CPU for this to work together

* Why rust?
I wanted to learn rust

The code in this repository is not the cleanest, as it's literally the first rust code I've ever written. Deal with it
